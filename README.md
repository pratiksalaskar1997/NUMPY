# NUMPY

NumPy is a general-purpose array-processing package. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays.

It is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains various features including these important ones:

A powerful N-dimensional array object
Sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
Tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
Useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities
Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data.
Arbitrary data-types can be defined using Numpy which allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.

Installation:

pip install numpy

Mac and Linux users can install NumPy via pip command:
pip install numpy
Windows does not have any package manager analogous to that in linux or mac.
Please download the pre-built windows installer for NumPy from here (according to your system configuration and Python version).
And then install the packages manually.
Note: All the examples discussed below will not run on an online IDE.
